# Medical-device-maintenance-analytics
A complete analytics and visualization project designed to support hospital  Biomedical Engineering and Health Informatics teams.
This dashboard analyzes:
- Equipment downtime
- Preventive maintenance compliance
- Common failure patterns
- Work order response times
- Inventory utilization
- Predictive failure risk (Machine Learning)

This project combines Biomedical Engineering knowledge with modern Health 
Informatics and analytics skills (Python, SQL, ML, Streamlit).

Features

Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning of maintenance logs  
- Categorization of device types  
- Time-series formatting for PM scheduling  

Analytics & KPIs
- Downtime per device  
- Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)  
- Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)  
- Preventive maintenance compliance %  
- Work order aging report  

Machine Learning Model
A predictive model using:
- Random Forest  
- Logistic Regression  
- Feature importance (SHAP)  

Predicts:
- High-risk devices likely to fail in the next 30 days.

Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)
Visualizes:
- Failure trends  
- Maintenance KPIs  
- Device risk scores  
- Inventory summaries  


Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Streamlit (Dashboard)
- Plotly (Interactive Charts)
- SQL (optional)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- SHAP (Model Explainability)
